# OOP_Practicals
This repository contains practical exercises and code examples for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in both C++ and Java.

here is description of each file.
# 1. Assignment10.java
Implement Java program to implement a base class consisting of the data members such as name of the student, roll number and subject. The derived class consists of the data member’s subject code, internal assessment and university examination marks. The program should have the facilities. i) Build a master table ii) List a table iii) Insert a new entry iv) Delete old entry v) Edit an entry vi) Search for a record. Use virtual functions.

# 2. Assignment11.java
Write a program to create multiple threads and demonstrate how two threads communicate with each other.

# 3. Calculator.java
Write a program in Java to implement a Calculator with simple arithmetic operations such as add, subtract, multiply, divide, factorial etc. using switch case and other simple java statements. 

# 4. Operations.java
Create an applet with three text Fields and four buttons add, subtract, multiply and divide. User will enter two values in the Text Fields. When any button is pressed, the corresponding operation is performed and the result is displayed in the third Text Fields.

# 5. Rectangle.java
Write a program in Java with class Rectangle with the data fields width, length, area and colour. The length, width and area are of double type and colour is of string type. The methods are get_length(), get_width(), get_colour() and find_area(). Create two objects of Rectangle and compare their area and colour. If the area and colour both are the same for the objects then display “Matching Rectangles”, otherwise display “Non-matching Rectangle”.

# 6. User.java
Write a java program to create User defined exception to check the following conditions and throw the exception if the criterion does not meet. (a) User has age between 18 and 55 (b)User stays has income between Rs.50,000 – Rs. 1,00,000 per month (c) User stays in Pune/ Mumbai/ Bangalore / Chennai (d)User has 4- wheeler Accept age, Income, City, Vehicle from the user and check for the conditions mentioned above. If any of the condition not met then throw the exception.

# 7. inheritacnce.java
Write a program in Java to create a player class. Inherit the classes Cricket_player, Football_player and Hockey_player from player class. The objective of this assignment is to learn the concepts of inheritance in Java.

# 8. book store.cpp
A Book shop maintains the inventory of books that are being sold at the shop. The list includes details such as title, author, publisher, price and available stock. Write a program in C++ which will have a class called books with suitable member functions for i) Add ii) Update iii) Search a book iv) Purchase a book (update the stock and display the total cost) v) Record number of successful/unsuccessful transactions (use static data members to keep count of transactions) Use new operator in constructors to allocate memory space required.

# 9. inheritance.cpp
Design a base class with name, date of birth, blood group and another base class consisting of the data members such as height and weight. Design one more base class consisting of the insurance policy number and contact address. The derived class contains the data members’ telephone numbers and driving license number. Write a menu driven program to carry out the following things: i) Build a master table ii) Display iii) Insert a new entry iv) Delete entry v) Edit vi) Search for a record

# 10. operator overloading.cpp
Design a class ‘Complex ‘with data members for real and imaginary part. Provide default and parameterized constructors. Write a program to perform arithmetic operations of two complex numbers using operator overloading. i) Addition and subtraction using friend functions ii) Multiplication and division using member functions

# 11. weather report.cpp
Create a class named weather report that holds a daily weather report with data members day_of_month, hightemp, lowtemp, amount_rain, and amount_snow. Use different types of constructor to initialize the objects. Also include a function that prompts the user and sets values for each field so that you can override the default values. Write a menu driven program inC++ with options to enter data and generate monthly report that displays average of each attribute.
